# Brain Decoding
Author: Shiva Shamloo

# Background

I'm a second year master student in Computer Science working in Bioinformatics. My research is mostly about applying AI algorithms to protein sequences which will affect the food productivity in aqriculture. My aim is to learn about different sciences as much as possible since I think they can be most useful when they are used together. 

# Project Definition
## Summary

My aim for the BrainHack School project is to stimulate mind reading that is by analyzing the brain we can guess what a person has seen or thinks. I tend to apply different classifiers and to find the best one. The ultimate goal which I don't think would be applicable during this summer school, would be to compare brain images from different people and understand a shared structure between brains.

## tools 
* Jupyter notebook
* Libraries: Scikit-learn, Nilearn, Seaborn, Numpy, PyTorch, Keras, Matplotlib
* Github

## Data

I will be using Haxby fMRI dataset provided by nilearn.

## Deliverables
By the end of this project, I will:

* have a gallery of visualized technics using the python libraries.
* get to use Github more often.
* have a better understanding with fMRI data.
