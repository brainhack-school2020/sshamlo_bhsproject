# Brain Decoding
Author: Shiva Shamloo

# Background

I'm a second year master student in Computer Science working in Bioinformatics. My research is mostly about applying AI algorithms to proteins. I'm still in the process of finding my best interest which I seem to narrow it down a bit. I have never used fMRI data but they always looked interesting to me.

# Project Definition
## Summary

My aim at this project is to stimulate mind reading that is by analyzing the brain we can guess what the person has seen or thinks. The ultimate goal which I don't think would be applicable during this summer school, would be to compare different personalities and understand a shared structure between brains.

## tools 
Jupyter notebook
Libraries: Scikit-learn, openML, Nilearn, Seaborn, Numpy

## Data

I will be using Haxby data provided by nilearn.
